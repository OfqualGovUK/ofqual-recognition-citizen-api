## About this project

This project is a ASP.NET Core 8 web api utilising Docker for deployment.

The web api runs on an App service for Container apps on Azure.

# Application Configuration Guide

This document outlines how the application is configured using `appsettings.json` files. These settings help manage behaviour across different environments and scenarios, including development, production and automated testing.

## Application Settings (`appsettings.json`)

The main application settings are defined in `appsettings.json` and can be tailored per environment using files like `appsettings.Development.json` or `appsettings.Production.json`.

    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "FeatureFlag": {
    "CheckUser": true,
